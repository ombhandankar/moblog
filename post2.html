            <p>So one of the most common thing running around in my mind right now is my SOP for my MSc. Along with of course the big black cloud of layoffs, college rejections, unavoidable doom of indian students looking to get into a uni in US.</p>
            
            <p>I have been thinking about the whole process of writing a SOP. I have been thinking about how to write a good SOP. I have been thinking about how to write a good SOP that is not just a copy of someone else's SOP. I have been thinking about how to write a good SOP that is not just a copy of someone else's SOP that is not just a copy of someone else's SOP. The above sentence is a good example of how to write a bad SOP. The entire para was just written by Copilot and I am not even kidding.</p>
            
            <p>Getting back to it. I think thats something to ruminate over. It could be that it is heavily influenced by the NodeJS wrapper around ffmpeg I am currently working on. We will find out. My current long mid term goal is to basically find a way to connect my job profile, the wrapper project, the HCI specialization that I am doing into a single coherent narrative, which not only ensures my way into a good uni but also helps me myself understand what i want to do.</p>

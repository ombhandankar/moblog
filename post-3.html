            <h2>Brain </h2>
            <p class="date">April 30th </p>
            <p> So i was pretty lazy for the past 2 weeks , wasnt really churning up anything un-related to work. </p>
            <p> Was able to put my brain into 3rd gear finally today and completed a module , pushed some new features to the wrapper. </p>
            <p> I want to improve my level of writing and one of the fundamental way to do that is to start reeading more. I used to read so much when I was younger , god feel so old saying that. Havent been able to finish a decent book this year. Just realised how bad that is.</p>
            <p> I find doing things on the  terminal very interesting. using some unkown kubernetes cmd , launching something . Just gives that whole matrix vibe.</p>
            <p> Had to disable co-pilot so that it doesnt irriate me with the suggestions/completions. Like if you though the code completion were bad wait till you start writing in VSCode. Does anyone even do that? have to look into that. </p>
            <p> This one became slightly informal . Want to do something in between . A blog that other people can read , which is casual but doensnt sound like a diary , AND is slightly technical. I think nay I know there is a sweet spot somewhere in there. I have read some like that </p>
            <p> I want to be better than those </p> 
            <p> Somewhere between a Karpathy and a Trung Phan . I think I will keep that as mid term goal. Lot of goals this year .</p>
